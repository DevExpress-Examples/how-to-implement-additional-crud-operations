# Extend CRUD Operations

After you bound the Data Grid to a database, you can implement CRUD operations (create, read update, delete). These operations allow users to manage data in the Data Grid.

[Documentation](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/401907/controls-and-libraries/data-grid/crud-operations) | [GitHub Example](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-implement-crud-operations)

This repository contains solutions that extend CRUD operations:

* Undo Operation
* Async CRUD Operations

## Undo Operation

The solution includes a behavior that allows users to undo the latest operation.

## Async CRUD Operations

The solution shows how to implement async CRUD operations.
